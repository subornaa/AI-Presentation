    "### Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "* ML is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Samuel A. 1959)\n",
    "* Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.\n",
    "* It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention (SAS, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Learning (SL)\n",
    "* SL often tries to capture the relationship between predictor and response variables in mathematical equations.\n",
    "* The focus is more on hypothesis testing, as assumptions such as normality, multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity are typical in statistical learning. \n",
    "* The terms SL and ML are often used interchangeably. Others may argue that they are two different fields. \n",
    "* SL and ML highly overlap, as both deal with data analysis. Both fields deal with making predictions as well as the formalization of relationships between variables (inference). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Big Data\n",
    "* Big data is associated with machine learning.\n",
    "* Massive data sets are currently available due to continuous data gathering and storing, possibly due to advanced sensor and communication techniques.\n",
    "* Data sets are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing applications and analysis with simple SL models.\n",
    "* Big data needs to be processed on multiple CPU cores on a single or multiple machines. \n",
